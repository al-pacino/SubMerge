1
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,233
Are you sure you have
the right keys?

2
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,634
Trust me, it's the right key.

3
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,302
Okay, then, open the door.

4
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,005
It shouldn't be taking so long,
man.

5
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,742
20, 19, 18...

6
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,611
Rocky, those are very
slow seconds.

7
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,779
- Yo, kill that already.
- 17, 16...

8
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,948
- Dude, come on.
- 15, 14, 13...

9
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,220
- This is what I'm talking about.
- 12, 11, 10, 9...

10
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,527
I told you this was
gonna be fancy.

11
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,664
All right, so,
just like last time.

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,666
No cash. The total take
has to fall below 10 g's.

13
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,468
Yeah, yeah.
Whatever, judge Judy.

14
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,371
Come on.
Let's do this.

15
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,402
Okay, let's get out of here.

16
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,307
Hey, rocky, did you hear
that Kopecky's moving away?

17
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,443
Everybody's leaving.

18
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,681
You know, if we keep hitting
houses like today's rocky,

19
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,117
and...
Bye-bye, Detroit.

20
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,354
And<i> hola,</i> California.

21
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,257
Wait, wait.
You're going away, rock?

22
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,425
Yeah, as soon as I can.

23
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,663
When are you,
when are you coming back?

24
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,032
Never.

25
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,836
You should come with us.

26
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,037
Uh...

27
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,839
What?

28
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,474
Everyone else is gone.

29
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,743
I got my dad here.

30
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,812
I'll miss you, then.

31
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,706
Dad?

32
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,942
You home?

33
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,457
Yo, this is it, man?

34
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,625
Minus my 40 percent.

35
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,327
Take it or leave it.

36
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,062
There's a fucking Rolex
in there, bro.

37
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,630
And what do you think,

38
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm going to put it up
for auction at Sotheby's?

39
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,871
Do you know how much

40
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,273
people on the street pay
for a hot Rolex?

41
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,642
You want money?

42
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,311
Then steal money.

43
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,380
Fucking bullshit, bro.

44
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,584
Do you want this new tip or not?

45
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,056
All right, let's hear it.

46
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,658
<i>1837 Buena vista street.</i>

47
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,527
House is with your dad's
security company.

48
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,895
I already checked.

49
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,098
Guy who owns it
is an army vet loner.

50
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,466
No family.

51
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,701
Just him in the house.

52
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,336
That part of the city
is a ghost town.

53
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,604
It looks like a dump.

54
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,139
That's actually good news.

55
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,507
How's that good news?

56
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,908
The story goes...

57
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,877
Some preppy girl,
a few years ago,

58
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,445
ran over this guy's daughter.

59
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,480
Jesus.
The daughter dies...

60
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,150
And this preppy,
rich-ass family

61
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,851
pays him off.

62
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,753
Gives him a big-ass
sediment.

63
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,455
Settlement.

64
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,956
Blow me, your honor.

65
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:09,961
All right, this guy
is sitting on at least...

66
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,230
300 k.

67
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:13,999
Boom!

68
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,469
I mean, if I deliver
this stake to Raul, man...

69
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,004
He will shit his pants.

70
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,473
Do you think the money's
in the house?

71
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,675
I don't know.
Let's go find out.

72
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,277
Guys, no.
We don't do cash.

73
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,611
Above 10 k, it's major larceny.

74
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,146
That means 10 years
if we get caught.

75
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,182
- We won't get caught.
- Okay, and then what?

76
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:32,250
That amount brings
a serious cop presence.

77
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,485
They'll do an investigation.

78
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,686
My dad could get in trouble.

79
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,154
I knew you'd bitch out, man.

80
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,789
I just knew it.

81
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,660
Alex, if we do this right,
we never have to do it again.

82
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,901
Where are you going?

83
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,004
We're not doing this one.

84
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,373
Seriously?

85
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,409
Give us the fucking keys, man.

86
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,810
We'll fucking do it.
Alex!

87
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,515
"Gulf war veteran reaches
six-figure settlement."

88
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,051
Six-figure settlement.

89
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,721
All right.

90
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:53,198
<i>The suspect was leaving
the rear entrance of the club.</i>

91
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Are you done, Diddy?

92
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,837
Be a doll and get your mother

93
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,972
a large four-cheese
from Tony's.

94
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,408
So Trevor's living here now?

95
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,943
Don't be a bitch, Roxanne.

96
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,546
It's just a few months
till he can find a new job.

97
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,447
You have no money in here.

98
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,750
You pay for it then.

99
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,786
I know you're making money.

100
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,525
I'm done.

101
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,861
Your lips look sore.

102
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,463
That's how you're making
your cash out there?

103
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,732
Ha, ha. Huh?

104
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,938
Okay, Diddy,
let's go for a walk.

105
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,508
I want to go to the beach.

106
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,545
Yeah, well,
it's not summer, monkeyhead.

107
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,347
I want to be a surfer.

108
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:45,951
There's no surf in Michigan.

109
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,421
Not fair.

110
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,056
Yeah, well...

111
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:55,026
some things
you can't change, baby.

112
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,129
No matter how unfair they are.

113
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,065
What a bummer.

114
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,870
Hey, you know
where there is surf?

115
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,207
California.

116
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,177
What do you say you and I
move there together?

117
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,378
Would you like that?

118
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,146
Okay.

119
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,648
I promise, then.

120
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,294
Is that a new tattoo?

121
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,495
Yeah.

122
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,797
I got it last night.

123
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,099
Is it a...?
Ladybug.

124
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,103
Why a ladybug?

125
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,408
What?

126
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,847
When my dad left,
my mom started drinking,

127
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,216
and she told me that

128
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,219
my dad's leaving
was all my fault.

129
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,992
And I missed him a lot,
so I'd cry.

130
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,095
She got so fed up with
the crying

131
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,864
that she would lock me
in the trunk of her car.

132
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,400
Sometimes for hours.

133
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,937
But there was this, um...

134
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,974
A little hole in the trunk,

135
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,143
and one time a ladybug flew in,

136
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,879
kept me company.

137
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,415
It made me feel safe.

138
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,853
When I reach California,
I'm gonna color this tat,

139
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:37,388
and that's the last time
I will mark my body.

140
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,799
If we get this money,
I'm going away with you guys.

141
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,338
I know you will.

142
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,014
At least four blocks around,
houses aren't occupied.

143
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,717
No people means
no five-o on patrol.

144
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,385
It's gonna be a piece of cake.

145
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,987
The guy's a shut-in,

146
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,855
hasn't left his house in,
like, five days.

147
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,524
I say we do it with
him in the house.

148
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,225
I'll get a chloro-bomb.

149
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,728
Oh, shit!

150
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,996
Jesus.
Fucking a.

151
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,531
Get off my fucking car,
dog shit!

152
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,841
Shit, that's our guy.

153
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,517
Wait, is he blind?

154
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,054
He lost his sight
in Iraq or something.

155
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,490
That's kind of fucked up to
rob a blind guy, isn't it?

156
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,359
Just because he's blind don't
mean he's a fucking Saint, bro.

157
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:51,796
We do this tonight.

158
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,290
The whole neighborhood
is fucking empty.

159
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:22,060
This guy's the last man
standing.

160
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:26,831
The lights are out.

161
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,233
He must be asleep.

162
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,934
He's blind.

163
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,569
Lights off doesn't
mean anything.

164
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,770
It's 2 A.M.

165
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,373
He's sleeping.

166
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,442
Let's take care of
that dog first, yeah?

167
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,202
Come on, man.

168
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,213
He's chewing it.

169
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,848
It'll be lights out in a sec.

170
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,090
There's four locks.
You got the other keys?

171
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,259
I only have the one.
Ah. Fuck me.

172
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,864
Why wouldn't he give backup
keys to the security company?

173
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:34,299
Because the money's in there,

174
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,168
and the paranoid fuck
doesn't trust nobody.

175
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,270
Let's check for a side door?

176
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,208
Sweet dreams, pup.

177
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,533
What's that?
We just have to point this

178
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,736
in the general direction
of the master keypad,

179
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:45,937
and it'll kill the alarm.

180
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,139
Okay, open the fucking door,
Dexter.

181
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,312
Yes. Got it.

182
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,313
Shit.

183
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,848
What's wrong?

184
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,249
It won't open.

185
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,763
This guy isn't messing around.

186
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,832
There's a bolt here.

187
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,534
I can feel it.

188
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,269
- Come on.
- That's too loud.

189
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,405
That's too loud.
Fucking stop.

190
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,709
What about that window?

191
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,644
There's no bars on it.

192
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,212
- I can fit in there.
- What?

193
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,481
No, we're not sending you
in there alone.

194
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,184
Nobody's sending me anywhere.

195
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,386
I'm going myself.

196
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,457
Help me up.

197
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,959
- Here, rocky.
- You only got 30 seconds.

198
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,161
Okay.

199
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,129
Here. Come here.

200
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,188
Slow your roll, fool.

201
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,590
She must have got it by now.
She's fine.

202
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,860
Yeah, like you
really give a fuck.

203
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,495
What'd you say?

204
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,964
That's my bitch in there.

205
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,033
Of course I give a fuck.

206
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,302
Let me give you some advice.

207
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,803
Be a good friend,

208
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:08,806
and stay in the fucking
friend zone, all right?

209
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:13,945
Are you okay?

210
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,246
Yes.

211
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,281
Shoes off.

212
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,028
What the fuck?
Hey.

213
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,478
Hey. Hey.

214
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,514
Okay.

215
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,187
<i>Just three seeds, right?</i>

216
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,955
<i>Just three?</i>

217
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:41,425
<i>One, two...</i>

218
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:44,428
<i>And three.</i>

219
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,465
<i>Put three seeds in there,</i>

220
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:49,767
<i>and the cup is all empty.</i>

221
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,472
<i>Now you water it?</i>

222
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,941
<i>Okay, now we water it.</i>

223
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,477
<i>Okay, mom.</i>

224
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,979
<i>Daddy, taste the water.</i>

225
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,323
<i>Just three seeds.</i>

226
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:14,325
<i>What are you doing?</i>

227
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,026
<i>Planting a tree.</i>

228
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:21,565
<i>How big is the tree
going to get?</i>

229
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,667
<i>As big as the sky!</i>

230
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,336
<i>Wow.</i>

231
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,576
<i>What does a tree need to grow?</i>

232
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:36,046
<i>Water, seeds, soil...</i>

233
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,848
<i>And... Sun.</i>

234
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,885
<i>Sounds good.</i>

235
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,713
<i>Then it will grow.</i>

236
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,218
<i>Mom, can I have more water?</i>

237
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,055
Done!

238
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:53,924
What the fuck, dude?

239
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,326
The guy's gassed out.

240
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,527
He's out.

241
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,728
He's in sleeping beauty mode.

242
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,697
It's fine.
Guys.

243
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,569
That's
a big-ass lock.

244
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,705
If the money's in the house...

245
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,674
Probably in there.

246
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,776
You think you can crack it open?

247
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:14,578
Yeah, I got this.

248
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:25,656
Fuck.

249
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,295
Jesus.

250
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,598
Do you have anything else?

251
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,233
Yeah.

252
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,501
Yeah, yeah.

253
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,004
I've got a more powerful tool.

254
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,307
What the hell is that?

255
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,875
It's a nine millimeter Beretta.

256
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,244
Gangster-style,
bitches.

257
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,679
Why'd you bring a gun?

258
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,214
This is a soldier's house, Alex.

259
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,249
Like I'm gonna come in here
without some chrome.

260
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,185
Money, you've never shot
a gun before.

261
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,388
Yeah, well, it's time to pop
that cherry, baby,

262
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,389
because I'm going to pop
that shit

263
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,957
like a fucking tuna can.

264
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,125
Do you have any idea what
bringing a gun

265
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,928
to a burglary means?
Yeah, it gives me

266
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,963
a better chance to
defend myself, Alex.

267
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,531
No, it means you
just gave this guy

268
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,633
the legal right to shoot us.

269
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:11,869
Rocky, let's go.

270
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:14,171
No, no, no, no.
I think we should stay.

271
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,408
We have to leave.
This is not good.

272
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,944
You don't really think
just because you jerk off

273
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:23,147
to her Instagram selfies
that makes you a Romeo?

274
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,949
Think again, bitch.

275
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,298
Fuck, I'm so out.

276
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,135
Alex.

277
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,953
Who's there?

278
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,668
Okay, man,
just chill, all right?

279
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,371
Look, um...

280
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:22,172
I was wasted...

281
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,541
And I wandered in,
so that was my bad, all right?

282
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:25,909
So, I'm just gonna...

283
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,978
I'm just gonna leave, okay?

284
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,094
Stay right fucking there.

285
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,896
Don't you fucking move.

286
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:50,134
Yeah, that's right.

287
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,703
I know what's in there,
and I ain't leaving without it.

288
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,171
You got me?

289
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,974
Now, you do as I say, all right?

290
00:27:56,976 --> 00:28:00,310
Don't take one single step,
all right? Huh?

291
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,784
Well, do you hear me or what?

292
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:09,920
What, are you blind
and deaf all of a sudden?

293
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:10,921
Huh?

294
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:13,824
Motherfucker, I said stop.

295
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:16,326
I think you fucking heard me.

296
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,195
Sorry.
Don't you move.

297
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,365
What the fuck are you doing,
you old man?

298
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,167
I'll fucking shoot you.

299
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,770
Don't you fucking test me.

300
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,344
You're a fucking pussy.

301
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,549
What are you gonna do now,
huh? Huh?

302
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,851
You better fucking stop.
Stop!

303
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,397
Don't make me
fucking kill you, man.

304
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,506
Please.

305
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:03,841
Please.

306
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:07,878
Please, just let me walk.

307
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,514
Let me walk.
Leave me alive.

308
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,985
Please.

309
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:18,155
How many of you are there?

310
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,623
What?

311
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,458
How many?

312
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,833
It's just me, man, all right?

313
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,536
It's just fucking me.
Just let me go!

314
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,439
Please let me go.

315
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,809
Please.

316
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,281
Just let me go.

317
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,421
Okay. Okay.

318
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,957
Okay.

319
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,459
Okay, I swear to god..

320
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,290
Rocky, hey, are you okay?

321
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,493
Are you okay?

322
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:33,029
Maybe... maybe we should
call the cops before he does.

323
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:35,132
We'll come clean...

324
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:38,168
Wait.

325
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,370
What?

326
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,530
Oh, my god.

327
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,714
There's a lot more
than 300 grand in there.

328
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:27,317
That's got to be
about a million dollars.

329
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:30,820
Okay, let's get out of here.

330
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,531
The storm cellar door, door's
bolted from the inside.

331
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,934
That could be our way out.

332
00:36:43,936 --> 00:36:45,869
Let's go.

333
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,510
Let's go.

334
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,950
This way.

335
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:48,151
What?

336
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:51,287
Oh, shit.
The phone died.

337
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,289
Fuck.

338
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,773
Hm.

339
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,676
Hm.

340
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,973
- Where's the door?
- I don't know.

341
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,642
Where is it? Do you see it?

342
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:29,112
Please help me! Please!

343
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:31,714
We need to get the fuck
out of here right now.

344
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,617
Come on. Let's go.

345
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,185
Look, the door's right here.

346
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:40,223
Look! Look at it!

347
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,625
Please!

348
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,330
What?

349
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:49,499
Rocky? Rocky.

350
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:51,501
Rocky, listen, listen.

351
00:42:51,503 --> 00:42:53,036
Hey, that's our exit.

352
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:55,505
The door's right fucking there.
We can leave right now.

353
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:57,473
No, no, no, no!

354
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,881
She's the one who
killed his daughter.

355
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,152
We have to get her out of here.

356
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,087
No, no, no. Rocky,
we don't have time.

357
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,356
We'll-we'll get out of here,
and we'll call the cops...

358
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:15,191
And then they'll come
find her, all right?

359
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,793
The safe! The safe!

360
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,361
There's the safe!

361
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,737
The code from the safe upstairs.

362
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,472
Do you remember it?
Um...

363
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:03,806
2978, 78, 78, 2978.

364
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,676
2-9-7-8.

365
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:08,177
Oh...

366
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,413
Okay, got them.

367
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,284
He's coming.

368
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:18,254
- Hurry up.
- Okay, one more, one more.

369
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,390
Fuck, fuck!

370
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:23,226
I almost have it.
Almost... Okay.

371
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,595
- I don't care what you did.
- I'll get you out of here.

372
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:27,930
Go, go, go!

373
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,312
- There's the door.
- There it is.

374
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,318
Are you okay?

375
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,720
Okay.

376
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,361
What's wrong?

377
00:45:00,632 --> 00:45:01,831
What's wrong?

378
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,399
It's locked.

379
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:06,769
- You have the keys.
- Don't you have the keys?

380
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:08,805
Fuck.

381
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:10,239
One of these should open it.

382
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:11,441
Come on.

383
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,944
Come on.

384
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,146
- Come on.
- Okay.

385
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,887
Oh, yes.

386
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,592
Come on.

387
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,186
He shot her.

388
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,687
No...

389
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:08,858
Oh.

390
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:12,962
No!

391
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,532
No!

392
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:19,869
Oh! Oh! Oh!

393
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:26,542
My baby.

394
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:34,150
No!

395
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,253
No!

396
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,390
No!

397
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,967
We have to go back upstairs.

398
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,702
Yeah, listen.

399
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:28,137
Listen, okay?

400
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,473
These keys, they match
the locks on the front door.

401
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:31,707
All right?

402
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,910
If we get up there,
we can get out.

403
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:35,912
Okay?

404
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,990
Let's go now.

405
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,540
Shit.

406
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,527
Alex?

407
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,705
Rocky?

408
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:05,261
Please don't...

409
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:10,733
No, please...

410
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,155
Rocky?

411
00:51:33,157 --> 00:51:35,224
Alex! Alex.

412
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:36,525
Rocky, rocky.

413
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:37,927
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.

414
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:40,029
This way.
This way, come on.

415
00:51:40,031 --> 00:51:41,630
This way, come on,
come on, come on.

416
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:42,765
Okay.

417
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,701
- Oh, come on.
- Where am I?

418
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:46,936
Where is it?

419
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,838
Light. I see light!

420
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,706
Come on, come on.

421
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:10,159
Don't... run.

422
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,732
Rocky...

423
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:20,936
Go to the door.

424
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,571
Try the blue key.

425
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,141
Do it.
Okay.

426
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,711
Easy.

427
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:29,912
Easy, buddy.

428
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,485
Fuck.

429
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:41,490
Rocky?
Yeah.

430
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:45,995
Come on.
Easy, buddy.

431
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:47,296
Easy.

432
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:49,965
It's okay.

433
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:54,970
Okay, that's a good boy.
That's good.

434
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:56,172
All right.

435
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:57,373
That's...

436
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:00,309
That's good. That's good.

437
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:03,846
Oh. Fuck.

438
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:06,148
Rocky! Rocky.
Run, now. Go, go, go!

439
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,950
Upstairs, now.
Go. Go, go!

440
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:11,854
Go! Hurry, hurry!

441
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:14,590
Go!

442
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:16,258
- There's a door!
- Come on!

443
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,294
Let's go.

444
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:20,963
Hey, move this.

445
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:22,398
Come on.

446
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,238
Damn.

447
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,308
Are those blocked up too?
Yeah.

448
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,343
We're trapped in here.

449
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,733
Rocky, the remote.
Do you have it with you?

450
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,668
Come on. Okay.

451
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,837
What are you doing?
I'm pressing the panic button.

452
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,073
If I manage to get in range,
the system will call 911

453
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:06,575
and the police will come.
No. Wait, we can't go to jail.

454
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,977
No. No,
we won't. Okay?

455
00:54:07,979 --> 00:54:09,979
This is robbery versus
kidnapping and murder.

456
00:54:09,981 --> 00:54:12,081
The police won't care about us,
or why we were here

457
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,650
in the first place. We would
have helped them get this guy.

458
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:16,285
But then we wouldn't
keep the money.

459
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:20,155
- We need to get out of this room.
- Up there.

460
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:26,428
Go!

461
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,372
Alex!

462
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:38,707
What are you doing? Go!

463
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:56,425
No! No, no!

464
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,456
Oh!

465
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,122
Hey!

466
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:58,327
Huh, huh!

467
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:08,163
Ah...

468
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,768
Ah!

469
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:25,560
Please, let me go.

470
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,465
Please, let me go!

471
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,004
I...

472
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:37,906
I understand you.

473
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:39,608
She killed your daughter.

474
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,142
You wanted her to pay.

475
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:42,477
I understand that.

476
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:44,079
I won't tell anyone.

477
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:46,248
You understand nothing.

478
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:51,119
Only a parent could know

479
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:54,990
the bond between a father
and his child.

480
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,696
She should have
gone to prison, but

481
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:04,099
rich girls don't go to jail.

482
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:10,205
None of this is going
to bring your daughter back.

483
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:18,179
That's not really true.

484
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,621
Cindy took my child
away from me.

485
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:31,593
I thought,

486
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:34,095
it's only fair

487
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,700
that she give me a new one.

488
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:45,307
She was pregnant with my baby.

489
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,246
You killed them both.

490
01:05:51,248 --> 01:05:53,281
No. Well, they would be alive

491
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,084
if you hadn't broken
into my home.

492
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:00,355
No.

493
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:11,099
You have to be held accountable.

494
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:22,831
Please.

495
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,034
Please, god.

496
01:08:26,036 --> 01:08:27,869
God?

497
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:29,871
There's no god.

498
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:35,110
It's a joke.

499
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:38,279
It's a bad joke.

500
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:43,218
You tell me what god
would allow this.

501
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,390
What are you doing?

502
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,763
I'm not a rapist.

503
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,766
I never forced myself on her.

504
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:01,536
Stop.

505
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:04,139
I promised I would set her free

506
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:06,508
just as soon
as she gave me a child.

507
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,016
But now she's gone.

508
01:09:15,018 --> 01:09:17,185
But I'm done waiting.

509
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,589
Ah! No. No, no.

510
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,459
You can't do this to me.

511
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:00,461
There's nothing a man cannot do

512
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:04,232
once he accepts the fact
that there is no god.

513
01:10:04,234 --> 01:10:06,067
No!

514
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:08,670
No. No, no, no, no!

515
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:09,938
No!

516
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:12,540
No!

517
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,975
You're strong.

518
01:10:15,212 --> 01:10:16,578
You're young.

519
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,114
You'll breed well.

520
01:10:20,116 --> 01:10:22,283
No. Get away from me.

521
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:26,054
No! No!

522
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,889
No!

523
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:33,294
No...

524
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:35,964
Stop.

525
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,634
Nine months,

526
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:41,769
and I will give you
your life back.

527
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:23,011
Are you okay?

528
01:11:23,013 --> 01:11:24,379
Rocky. Okay, yeah.

529
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:27,115
Rocky, did he...?
Did he hurt you?

530
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:28,483
Rocky?

531
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:32,654
You fucking bastard.

532
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:48,136
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, rocky. Rocky.

533
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:50,905
Rocky. Rocky, it's over.
Come on.

534
01:11:50,907 --> 01:11:52,707
How's that taste?

535
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,715
Now what?
Come on.

536
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,059
You're going to rot in prison
for what you've done.

537
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:13,795
Rocky, we can't
involve the cops now.

538
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:15,830
If we steal a million in cash

539
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,299
and then lead the cops here,
he'll tell them about us.

540
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:21,169
Our blood is all over.
They'll get to us in a second.

541
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:24,138
You got what you came for.

542
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,043
Now take it.

543
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:31,312
Get out of my house!

544
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,085
Look, he's buying our silence.

545
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:38,753
He needs us to take the money.

546
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,689
It's one or the other.

547
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,593
Whatever you choose,
I'm with you.

548
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,971
Okay.
This one.

549
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:59,674
Let's get out of here.

550
01:12:59,676 --> 01:13:01,242
I need to find the key.

551
01:13:01,244 --> 01:13:02,710
All right.

552
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,415
That key won't...

553
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:09,851
I got it.

554
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,736
You're worthless out here.

555
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:07,008
Fuck.

556
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:16,884
Shit!

557
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,600
Fuck.

558
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:42,136
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

559
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:43,504
Ah, fuck!

560
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:49,857
I'm sorry, Alex.

561
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,893
I'm so sorry.

562
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,699
No!

563
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:34,902
Don't!

564
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:39,540
Ah, no...

565
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:41,408
No. Ah!

566
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:53,154
Ah! Don't...

567
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:10,237
No.

568
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:58,145
What is that?

569
01:21:58,147 --> 01:22:01,382
You and me at the beach.

570
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,154
<i>Train service to Los Angeles</i>

571
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:10,925
<i>will be boarding shortly
on platform six.</i>

572
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:13,460
<i>This house behind me
on Buena vista</i>

573
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:15,396
<i>belongs to a retired army vet</i>

574
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:17,464
<i>who fought
for our country in Iraq</i>

575
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:21,468
<i>and lost his sight as a result
of a grenade splinter.</i>

576
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,504
<i>Last night, two burglars
broke into his home</i>

577
01:22:23,506 --> 01:22:26,440
<i>and attempted to rob
and brutally attack him.</i>

578
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:29,777
<i>This visually impaired man
was able to defend himself,</i>

579
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:32,246
<i>shooting and killing
both his attackers on the spot.</i>

580
01:22:32,248 --> 01:22:34,515
<i>Now, the man did
sustain some injuries,</i>

581
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:36,350
<i>but doctors say he is
in stable condition.</i>

582
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:39,053
<i>He'll be released

583
01:22:39,055 --> 01:22:40,854
<i>and able to return to his home.</i>

584
01:22:40,856 --> 01:22:44,458
<i>No goods were reported stolen
by the victim.</i>

585
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,962
<i>I'm Dayna Clark, WADL news.</i>
